## _iop_accesscontrol_fkie:_ AccessControl

Implements the functionality for exclusive control. By default a timeout of 10 seconds is active. You have to send your requests within this time as not to lose the control.

#### Parameter:

_access_timeout (int_, (Default: 10)

> Time period in seconds after which the exclusive control goes lost. Zero disables the timeout.


#### Publisher:

_is_controlled (std_msgs::Bool)_, latched

> Publishes True or False if the service is controlled by someone or not

#### Subscriber:

> None

## _iop_accesscontrol_fkie:_ AccessControlClient

The client service for AccessControl. It offers the functionality to send access requests in periodic time specified by AccessControl service.



## _iop_discovery_fkie:_ Discovery

The discovery service holds information about System, Subsystem, Node or Component depend on the configuration parameter _system_id_. It should by only one service with type __Subsystem__ in your subsystem. Each component can include this service to provide a name of the component.

#### Parameter:

_system_id (int_, (Default: 4)

> The ID of the service: 0: Reserved, 1: System Identification, 2: Subsystem Identification, 3: Node Identification, 4: Component Identification, 5 â€“ 255: Reserved

_system_type (int_, (Default: 60001)

> 10001: VEHICLE, 20001: OCU, 30001: OTHER_SUBSYSTEM, 40001: NODE, 50001: PAYLOAD, 60001: COMPONENT

_name_subsystem (str_, (Default: Robotname)

> The name of the robot. Only used if the _system_id_ is set to 2 (subsystem).

_name_node (str_, (Default: Componentname)

> The name of the component which includes this service.


#### Publisher:

> None

#### Subscriber:

> None


## _iop_discovery_fkie:_ DiscoveryClient

A client service to discover other IOP services and register own services by Discovery service of _subsystem_ type. It provide also a ROS publisher with all discovered services.

#### Parameter:

_system_id (int_, (Default: 4)

> This parameter influence the discover update behaviour only if ROS interface is disabled and all IOP services are already discovered. The same type as in Discovery.

_register_own_services (bool_, (Default: true)

> You can prevent the registration of own services by discovery service. It is useful in case of OCU services.

_force_component_update_after (int_, (Default: 300)

> Force the request of service list for all known robot.

_enable_ros_interface (bool_, (Default: false)

> Publish the discovered services to the ROS network. On false the publisher are not created.


#### Publisher:

_/iop_identification (iop_msgs_fkie::Identification)_

> Publishes the identification report to the ROS network.

_/iop_system (iop_msgs_fkie::System)_, latched

> Publishes all services of all discovered subsystems on every detected change.

#### Subscriber:

> None

#### Services:

_/iop_query_identification (iop_msgs_fkie::QueryIdentification)_

> Request an identification for provided system id.

_/iop_update_discovery (std_srvs::Empty)_

> Tries to update the whole system.



## _iop_events_fkie:_ Events

The Events service implements the functionality to send registered events. The events are reports registered by plugins on load. Events supports periodic and on change notifications. Currently CommandEvents are not supported.

#### Parameter:

_events_timeout (int_, (Default: 1)

> Time period in minutes after which the event will be canceled if no update for event received. Zero disables the timeout.

#### Publisher:

> None

#### Subscriber:

> None

## _iop_events_fkie:_ EventsClient

This service register events on Events service and update it to avoid timeout or if change for event is needed. The received events forwarded to handler plugin which requested the report by event.

#### Parameter:

> None

#### Publisher:

> None

#### Subscriber:

> None


## _iop_list_manager_fkie:_ ListManager

Implements list manager functionality used e.g. by GlobalWaypointListDriver

#### Parameter:

> None

#### Publisher:

> None

#### Subscriber:

> None


## _iop_list_manager_fkie:_ ListManagerClient

Implements client for list manager functionality used e.g. by GlobalWaypointListDriverClient

#### Parameter:

> None

#### Publisher:

> None

#### Subscriber:

> None



## _iop_liveness_fkie:_ Liveness

This service sends ReportHeartbeatPulse on request or as event.

#### Parameter:

> None

#### Publisher:

> None

#### Subscriber:

> None



## _iop_management_fkie:_ Management

Implements rudimentary management functions.

#### Parameter:

> None

#### Publisher:

_is_emergency (std_msgs::Bool)_, latched

> Publishes __true__ if the component changes into emergency state settled  by client.

_is_ready (std_msgs::Bool)_, latched

> Publishes __true__ if the component changes in the ready state.

#### Subscriber:

> None

## _iop_management_fkie:_ ManagementClient

Currently only "Resume" implemented. This is used by Slave library. The possibility to change into other state are not supported.

#### Parameter:

> None

#### Publisher:

> None

#### Subscriber:

> None

## _iop_transport_fkie:_ Transport

No function beside generated code, it's only plugin.
